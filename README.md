Nick's Hack pad is a 5 key macropad allowing individuals to utilize 8 keys (or macros) while only using one hand. 


Features:
Beautifully designed case (although it may look like an item that americans are known for)

Incredible design (with 4 keys for the four fingers and one for your thumb)

Easy to change firmware with just a few clicks to change what the hackpad does. 

CAD Model:

Everything fits together using 6 M3 Bolts . All of which go on the outside of the case. 

The Cad model has two parts. The base which is where the pcb sits and the top which snaps on to make it a cleaner look.
